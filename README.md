# CppNeuralNetwork
A **neural network** written in **C++**, aiming to be **as fast as possible¹** by using **C arrays** and only **raw values instead of objects** _(May be hard to read because of that)_

I've currently trained it to solve **XOR**.

## Benchmarks
It's pretty fast (TODO)


¹: I'm new to C/C++ so; **as fast as I can do it**
